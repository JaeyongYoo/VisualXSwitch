CHANGELOG: This is a short log for the changes in each version. 
	   For more information, read README and find 
	   "2020-00-00[Self-Teaching] FlowNet Click Element Script.ppt" 
	   powerpoint material. 


* FlowNet-v0.5.1
	- First branch of FlowNet


* FlowNet-v0.5.2 (2011-09-16)

	- Clean the MPEG2 parsing (written by SangHoon Park) and apply open-source-code MPEG2 analyzer

	- Add an algorithm "congestion detection (CD) based shape with cross-flow balancing" for BW shaping
	
	- Add scheduling algorithms :log-weight, virtual-pressure, shadow-queuing

* FlowNet-v0.6.0 (2011-09-27)
	
	- Scheduling Framework Major Change
		
		* New inner-loop backpressure scheduler (DAMPING-SCHEDULE: rename required)
	
		* Support inner-loop and outer-loop control (All the existing schedulers become inner-loop controls)
		
		* For outer-loop control, we monitor and manipulate MAC-layer params (requires MadWiFi version <= 0.9.x)

		* Scheduling framework maintains multiple congestion detection algorithm pools and activate them at the same time.
		  The shapers can register what congestion detection algorithm they want to get a congestion indiciation callback event.

	- Add several CD algorithms: CD_Threshold, CD_Proportional, etc

	- Change the name of BWShapeByCD (also BWShapeByCD_CFB) to BWShapeByCDCORE since now other shaping algorithms depend on CD (Congestion Detection)
		
* FlowNet-v0.6.1 (2012-01-30)

	- Now, FlowNet-v0.6.1 includes VxS. (NOTE: this inclusion may cause the confusion but, at the moment, 
	  we do not strictly separate between FlowNet and others. It is more likely FlowNet is the main project that includes all).
	
	- OpenFlow applies patches for 64bit architecture. For this, we move from shallow copy to deep copy of OpenFlow-Click-Packet-Translation 

	- Got rid of CD_Proportional and make another type of CD (CD_Direct) that is one and the only compatible one to VcBWShapeProportional
