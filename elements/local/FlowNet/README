1. Introduction


2. FlowNet software architecture

	- Conceptually, it consists of Frameworks and Algorithms.
	
	- Framworks:
		1. Per-flow Scheduling Framework	(PFSchedFW class)
		2. Per-flow Shaping Framework		(PFShapeFW class)
		3. Per-flow MPEG2 Adaptation Framework	(PFMpeg2AdaptFW class)

	- Each framework has a skeleton implementation of abstracted algorithms.
	  The framework-abstracted-algorithm inclusion-relation are as follows

		1. Per-flow Scheduling Framework includes

			A. Flow Classification Algorithm	(VcFlowClassify class)
			B. (Flow) Table Algorithm		(VcTable class)
			C. Scheduling Algorithm			(VcSchedule class)
			D. Congestion Detection Algorithm	(VcCongestionDetection class)
				: This Congestion Detection Algorithms are maintained as a pool
				  and every flow that passes this scheduler use all the algorithms
				  in the pool and detects congestions. These congestions are
				  reported to shapers for further actions.
				  Note that the shaper also has to register itself to the congestion
				  detection algorithms to set its callback function to them.

		2. Per-flow Shaping Framework includes
			A. Flow Classification Algorithm	(VcFlowClassify class)
			B. (Flow) Table Algorithm		(VcTable class)
			C. Bandwidth Shaping Algorithm		(VcBWShape class)
		
		3. Per-flow MPEG2 Adaptation Framework includes
			A. Flow Classification Algorithm	(VcFlowClassify class)
			B. (Flow) Table Algorithm		(VcTable class)


	- We have the following implemented algorithms

		1. Flow Classification Algorithm
			A. Vc5TupleClassify	(Name: "5TupleClassify")
			B. VcNoClassify		(Name: "NoClassify")

		2. (Flow) Table Algorithm
			A. VcTable		(No name is allocated this one TODO: Fix this) 
	
		3. Scheduling Algorithm (Inner-loop)
			A. VcScheduleBackpressure	(Name: "ScheduleBackpressure")
			B. VcScheduleNoSchedule		(Name: "ScheduleNoSchedule")
			C. VcScheduleHorizon		(Name: "ScheduleHorizon")
			D. VcScheduleWBS		(Name: "ScheduleWBS")
				- Note that WBS (Weighted Backpressure Scheduling) requires 
				  "WBS_BETA" and "WBS_GAMMA" for the configuration
			E. VcScheduleLogWeight		(Name: "ScheduleLogWeight")

		4. Scheduling Algorithm (Outer-loop)
			A. VcScheduleOuterVirtualpressure	(Name: "ScheduleOuterVirtualpressure")
			B. VcScheduleOuterNoSchedule		(Name: "ScheduleOuterNoSchedule")
		
		5. Congestion Detection Algorithm /* (TODO: make a table for possible combinations of CD and shaping */
			A. VcCDCORE		(Name: "CDCORE")
			B. VcCDQueueLoss	(Name: "CDQueueLoss")
			C. VcCDThreshold	(Name: "CDThreshold")
			D. VcCDDirect		(Name: "CDDirect") /* only compatible to VcBWShapeProportional */
		
		6. Bandwidth Shaping Algorithm
			A. VcBWShapeByCDCORE	(Name: "ByCDCORE")
			B. VcBWShapeByCDCORE_CFB	(Name: "ByCDCORE_CFB")
			C. VcBWShapeNULL	(Name: "NULL")
			D. VcBWShapeSimple	(Name: "Simple")
			E. VcBWShapeStaticMpeg2 (Name: "StaticMpeg2")
			F. VcBWShapeProportional	(Name: "Proportional") /* only compatible to VcCDDirect */

	- In theory, you can combinate any algorithms to operate FlowNet

3. Description of Frameworks
	- To be written

4. Description of Algorithms
	- To be written
